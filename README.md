## 📊 Solution Architecture

This project implements a Medallion-style architecture consisting of three processing layers:

![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture.png)

### Bronze Layer

* Stores source data in its original format.
* Loads ERP and CRM CSV files into SQL Server without significant transformations.
* Acts as the system's raw data repository.

### Silver Layer

* Performs data cleansing and validation.
* Standardizes formats and resolves quality issues.
* Produces consistent and reliable datasets for downstream processing.

### Gold Layer

* Contains curated business-ready datasets.
* Implements dimensional modeling using a star schema design.
* Supports reporting, dashboarding, and analytical workloads.

## 🎯 Business Requirements

### Data Warehouse Development

#### Goal

Build a SQL Server data warehouse that consolidates sales-related information from different operational systems into a single analytical platform.

#### Requirements

* Import ERP and CRM datasets provided as CSV files.
* Address data quality issues during transformation stages.
* Merge multiple source systems into a unified analytical model.
* Focus on the most recent available data (historical tracking is out of scope).
* Maintain documentation describing the warehouse structure and business entities.
